## Abstract 
The main question is embedded into the title of this project; _**just how impactful is sleep for a college student?**_ This question is important because for the lives of many students, healthy sleep is not a high priority to them and in most cases is often neglected. To address the question, we will look into datasets that provide insightful information about studentsâ€™ grades, health, and overall well-being in correlation to their sleeping habits.
